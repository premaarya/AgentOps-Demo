  "clause_types": ["liability"],
  "rule_type": "threshold",
  "condition": {
    "operator": "gt",
    "field": "liability_amount",
    "value": 5000000
  },
  "severity": "high",
  "message_template": "Liability cap {actual_value} exceeds policy maximum of {policy_value}",
  "effective_date": "2024-01-01",
  "enabled": true
}
```
