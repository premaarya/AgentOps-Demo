# Azure Deployment Automation

This repo now uses GitHub Actions workflows from the repository root for CI and Azure CD of the `contract-agentops-demo` app.

## Workflows

- Root CI workflow: `.github/workflows/contract-agentops-ci.yml`
- Root deployment workflow: `.github/workflows/contract-agentops-deploy.yml`

These workflows are placed at the repository root because GitHub Actions does not execute workflow files stored under `contract-agentops-demo/.github/workflows/`.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Configure these repository or environment secrets before running the deployment workflow:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

Foundry endpoint and API key secrets are no longer required. The deployment workflow provisions the Azure OpenAI account through Bicep and wires the generated endpoint and key into App Service settings.

## Triggers

- Push to `main` deploys automatically to `contract-agentops-main`
- Push of tags matching `v*` deploys automatically to `contract-agentops-prod`
- `workflow_dispatch` remains available for manual overrides

## Manual Workflow Inputs

- `demo_mode` default: `live`
- `environment_name` default: `contract-agentops-prod`
- `azure_location` default: `eastus2`
- `foundry_model` default: `gpt-4o`
- `foundry_model_version` default: `2024-11-20`

## Deployment Flow

The deployment workflow performs these steps:

1. Validate the app with lint, typecheck, tests, and build.
2. Authenticate to Azure using a service principal.
3. Resolve deployment defaults from the triggering branch, tag, or manual inputs.
4. Generate a deployment admin key for the live-mode registration hook.
5. Select or create the `azd` environment.
6. Run `azd provision` to create the resource group, App Service plan, App Service, and Azure OpenAI account.
7. Check whether the configured model deployment already exists and create it only when missing.
8. Run `azd deploy`.
9. Verify health, deployment mode, deployment status, agent registration, and evaluation output.

## Notes

- `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` now falls back to `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` when not explicitly set.
- The deployment verification script is at `contract-agentops-demo/scripts/deploy/verify-deployment.ps1`.
- The post-deploy `azd` hook invokes `POST /api/v1/deploy/pipeline` on the deployed app and now fails the deployment on any non-2xx response.
- In live mode, the hook automatically supplies `x-admin-key` using the generated `DEPLOY_ADMIN_KEY` environment value.
- The root CI workflow also enforces lint, typecheck, tests, and build for `contract-agentops-demo` changes.
