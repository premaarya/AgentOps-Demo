# Contract AgentOps Demo Setup and Deployment Guide

This guide covers local setup, live-mode configuration with Azure AI Foundry, and Azure deployment using Azure Developer CLI (`azd`).

## Overview

The solution runs as a single Node.js application hosted by the gateway. The gateway serves the static UI and starts the MCP servers as child processes.

Execution modes:

- `simulated`: Uses local sample data and does not require Azure AI Foundry credentials.
- `live`: Uses Azure AI Foundry credentials and real model calls.

Azure hosting model:

- Azure App Service for the application runtime
- Azure Container Apps as an optional containerized runtime
- Bicep infrastructure under `infra/`
- `azd` orchestration via `azure.yaml`

## What Gets Deployed

The Azure deployment provisions:

- One resource group
- One Azure OpenAI account
- One Linux Azure App Service Plan
- One Linux Azure App Service running `npx tsx start.ts`

Optional ACA deployment provisions:

- One ACA-specific resource group
- One Azure Container Registry
- One Log Analytics workspace
- One Azure Container Apps managed environment
- One user-assigned managed identity for ACR pulls and Foundry runtime access
- One Azure Container App running the same Node entrypoint in a container image

The App Service is configured with:

- `DEMO_MODE`
- `DEPLOY_ADMIN_KEY`
- `FOUNDRY_AUTH_MODE=managed-identity`
- `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`
- `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`
- `FOUNDRY_MODEL`
- `GATEWAY_PORT=8080`
- `NODE_ENV=production`

After deployment, `azd` runs a post-deploy hook that calls `POST /api/v1/deploy/pipeline` on the deployed app.

## Prerequisites

Install these locally before setup or deployment:

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm
- Git
- Azure CLI
- Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

Optional but useful:

- `curl` for API verification
- Azure Portal access for inspecting deployed resources

For live mode, you also need:

- An Azure subscription
- Permission to create Azure OpenAI resources and model deployments in that subscription
- Permission to create Azure RBAC role assignments for the managed identities used by App Service and ACA

## Local Setup

Run all commands from the app root:

```powershell
cd "c:\Piyush - Personal\GenAI\Contract Management"
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Create your local environment file:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

### Local Simulated Mode

This is the fastest path and does not require Azure credentials.

Set these values in `.env`:

```env
DEMO_MODE=simulated
GATEWAY_PORT=8000
MCP_BASE_PORT=9001
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Start the stack:

```powershell
npm start
```

Verify:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tools
```

UI URL:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

### Local Live Mode

Live mode requires Foundry settings. Update `.env`:

```env
DEMO_MODE=live
FOUNDRY_AUTH_MODE=api-key
FOUNDRY_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.openai.azure.com
FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=
FOUNDRY_MODEL=gpt-5.4
FOUNDRY_MODEL_SWAP=gpt-4o-mini
GATEWAY_PORT=8000
MCP_BASE_PORT=9001
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Then start the stack:

```powershell
npm start
```

If `FOUNDRY_API_KEY` or `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` is missing, the gateway will fail fast at startup. `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` is optional and defaults to `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`.

For Microsoft Entra authentication instead of key-based auth, set `FOUNDRY_AUTH_MODE=managed-identity`, keep `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`, and optionally set `FOUNDRY_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID` when you are using a user-assigned identity.

## Local Validation

Recommended checks before deployment:

```powershell
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run lint
```

Additional smoke tests:

```powershell
npx tsx tests/test-comprehensive.ts
npx tsx tests/test-deployment.ts
```

## Azure Deployment with azd

Run all commands from:

```powershell
cd "c:\Piyush - Personal\GenAI\Contract Management"
```

### 1. Sign in

```powershell
az login
azd auth login
```

If you use multiple subscriptions, select the right one first:

```powershell
az account set --subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"
```

### 2. Create or Select an azd Environment

```powershell
azd env new contract-agentops-dev
```

Set deployment values:

```powershell
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus2
azd env set FOUNDRY_MODEL gpt-5.4
azd env set FOUNDRY_MODEL_VERSION 2024-11-20
azd env set DEMO_MODE live
```

Use `DEMO_MODE=simulated` only when you want the Azure-hosted app to avoid live Foundry calls. In the default live path, the Azure OpenAI account is provisioned through Bicep and the workflow creates the model deployment only when it does not already exist.

### 3. Provision and Deploy

```powershell
azd up
```

What `azd up` does in this repo:

- Provisions Azure resources from `infra/main.bicep`
- Creates the Azure OpenAI account used by the gateway
- Deploys the app to Azure App Service
- Runs the `postdeploy` hook in `azure.yaml`
- Calls `POST /api/v1/deploy/pipeline` on the deployed app and fails the deployment if registration does not succeed

### 4. Get the Deployed URL

```powershell
azd env get-value AZURE_APP_SERVICE_URL
```

### 5. Verify the Deployment

Set the URL in your shell:

```powershell
$APP_URL = azd env get-value AZURE_APP_SERVICE_URL
```

Run these checks:

```powershell
curl "$APP_URL/api/v1/health"
curl "$APP_URL/api/v1/deploy/mode"
curl "$APP_URL/api/v1/deploy/status"
```

If you want to manually rerun the deployment registration pipeline:

```powershell
$headers = @{ "x-admin-key" = (azd env get-value DEPLOY_ADMIN_KEY) }
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$APP_URL/api/v1/deploy/pipeline" -Headers $headers
```

Open the UI:

```text
<AZURE_APP_SERVICE_URL>
```

## Live-Mode Azure Deployment

The Azure infrastructure now provisions the Azure OpenAI account through Bicep, enables a system-assigned managed identity on App Service, and grants that identity `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` on the Azure OpenAI resource. `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` remains optional and defaults to the same endpoint.

For live mode, set these `azd` environment values before deployment:

```powershell
azd env set FOUNDRY_MODEL gpt-5.4
azd env set FOUNDRY_MODEL_VERSION 2024-11-20
azd env set DEMO_MODE live
```

Then deploy:

```powershell
azd up
```

## Azure Container Apps Deployment

Use this path when you want containerized hosting, cleaner scale boundaries, or a future split between gateway and background agent workloads.

The ACA deployment path uses the root GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/contract-agentops-deploy-aca.yml` and the infrastructure template at `infra/container-apps.bicep`.

### Required GitHub Secrets

Configure the same Azure service principal secrets used by the App Service workflow:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

### What the ACA workflow does

1. Validates the app with lint, typecheck, tests, and build.
2. Provisions ACA base infrastructure and Azure OpenAI resources.
3. Builds the application image in Azure Container Registry.
4. Creates or updates the Azure Container App.
5. Verifies `/api/v1/health`, deployment mode, deployment status, and agent registration.

### Manual ACA deployment trigger

Run the root workflow `Contract AgentOps Deploy ACA` with these defaults unless you need overrides:

- `demo_mode=live`
- `environment_name=contract-agentops-aca-prod`
- `azure_location=eastus2`
- `foundry_model=gpt-5.4`
- `foundry_model_version=2024-11-20`

### ACA runtime notes

- The container image starts the same `npm start` entrypoint used locally.
- The container app exposes port `8000` and maps it to the gateway health endpoint at `/api/v1/health`.
- The deployment still uses `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` fallback behavior and injects `DEPLOY_ADMIN_KEY` for live-mode registration.
- The ACA runtime uses `FOUNDRY_AUTH_MODE=managed-identity` and the user-assigned identity from `infra/container-apps.bicep` instead of injecting `FOUNDRY_API_KEY`.
- The App Service runtime now also uses `FOUNDRY_AUTH_MODE=managed-identity`, backed by its system-assigned identity and the same OpenAI data-plane RBAC role.

Then verify:

```powershell
$APP_URL = azd env get-value AZURE_APP_SERVICE_URL
curl "$APP_URL/api/v1/deploy/mode"
curl "$APP_URL/api/v1/deploy/status"
```

The default GitHub Actions deployment path remains App Service. ACA is a manual opt-in workflow.

## Operational Notes

Current behavior in this repo:

- The App Service startup command is `npx tsx start.ts`
- `start.ts` launches the MCP servers and gateway in one app process tree
- The gateway serves the UI from `ui/`
- Health is exposed at `/api/v1/health`

Current security posture:

- App Service live mode uses API-key based Foundry access
- ACA live mode uses managed identity for Foundry access
- Both deployment lanes still use `DEPLOY_ADMIN_KEY` to protect registration routes

## Troubleshooting

### App fails in live mode at startup

Likely cause:

- Missing `FOUNDRY_API_KEY` when `FOUNDRY_AUTH_MODE=api-key`
- Missing `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`
- Missing `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` role assignment for the Azure runtime identity

`FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` is optional and defaults to `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`.

Check the deployment mode endpoint and App Service settings.

### postdeploy hook does not register agents

Check:

- The app is reachable at `AZURE_APP_SERVICE_URL`
- The app finished starting before the hook ran
- `POST /api/v1/deploy/pipeline` succeeds manually

### Need to inspect App Service logs

```powershell
$RG = azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP
$APP_NAME = az webapp list --resource-group $RG --query "[0].name" -o tsv
az webapp log tail --resource-group $RG --name $APP_NAME
```

### Health endpoint shows MCP servers offline

The gateway checks MCP servers on localhost ports `9001` through `9008`. If those are offline, the startup command may have failed before the child processes were fully launched.

## GitHub Actions Deployment

GitHub Actions workflows now live at the repository root:

- `.github/workflows/contract-agentops-ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/contract-agentops-deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/contract-agentops-deploy-aca.yml`

See `docs/deployment/AZURE-GITHUB-ACTIONS.md` for both App Service and ACA deployment flows.

## Recommended Deployment Flow

For the current repo state, use this sequence:

1. Validate locally in `simulated` mode.
2. Deploy to Azure with `DEMO_MODE=simulated` using `azd up` or the root deployment workflow.
3. Verify health, UI, and deployment status on Azure.
4. Switch the environment to `DEMO_MODE=live` once Foundry settings are available.
5. Re-run `POST /api/v1/deploy/pipeline` or the deployment workflow and validate live behavior.
6. Use the ACA workflow when you need a containerized runtime or want to evolve toward independently deployable agent workloads.
