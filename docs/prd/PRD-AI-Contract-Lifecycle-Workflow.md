## 1. Problem Statement

Organizations still manage contract workflows through fragmented tools, email chains, manual reviews, and spreadsheet-based follow-up. The result is slow cycle time, inconsistent risk handling, missed obligations, delayed signatures, and poor portfolio visibility.

This PRD defines the **business workflow** for contracts. It is intentionally separate from the existing **AgentOps lifecycle**, which remains the SDLC and operational lifecycle for designing, testing, deploying, monitoring, evaluating, and improving AI agents.

The target product is an AI-driven contract lifecycle workflow that turns the full contract journey into an orchestrated, stage-aware system:

| Stage | Current Pain | AI Opportunity |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 1. Request / Initiation | Wrong template selected, incomplete intake | AI-guided intake, smart template recommendation |
| 2. Authoring / Drafting | Starting from scratch, inconsistent clauses | AI drafting assistant, approved clause suggestions |
| 3. Internal Review | Manual redlines, version confusion, email chains | AI redline suggestions, version diff, explainable change summaries |
| 4. Compliance Check | Manual scanning against policy and regulation | AI compliance scoring, deviations, regulatory mapping |
| 5. Negotiation / External Review | Counterparty redlines, unacceptable clauses | Clause-level risk scoring, accept/reject/revise recommendations |
| 6. Approval Routing | Wrong approver, missed escalations, bottlenecks | Smart routing based on type, value, region, and risk |
| 7. Execution / Signature | Manual signature follow-up and delays | E-sign integration, reminders, evidence trail |
| 8. Post-Execution / Obligations | Obligations buried in text, dates missed | Obligation extraction, milestone alerts, owner assignment |
| 9. Renewal / Expiry | Auto-renewals missed, renegotiations too late | Renewal intelligence, early warning alerts, portfolio prioritization |
| 10. Analytics | No visibility into cycle time or risk concentration | Contract dashboards, SLA tracking, risk and renewal KPIs |

### Why this matters

- Legal and business teams need faster turnaround without losing governance.
- AI can remove repetitive work, but only if paired with deterministic guardrails and human review.
- Contract value is created across the entire lifecycle, not only at drafting or signature.
- Most contract tools still solve isolated steps instead of the full workflow end to end.

### Workflow Separation Principle

The product must preserve two distinct but connected lifecycle models:

| Lifecycle | Purpose | Example Stages |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Contract Lifecycle | Business workflow for moving an agreement from request through renewal | Request, Drafting, Review, Compliance, Negotiation, Approval, Signature, Obligations, Renewal, Analytics |
| AgentOps Lifecycle | SDLC and operational workflow for building, validating, deploying, observing, and improving the AI system | Design, Test, Deploy, Run, Monitor, Evaluate, Detect, Feedback |

The contract workflow answers **where the agreement is in the business process**.
The AgentOps workflow answers **how the AI system supporting that process is designed, validated, deployed, and improved**.

These lifecycles must not be collapsed into one model. Instead:

- Contract Lifecycle remains the user-facing business workflow.
- AgentOps remains the engineering and operational workflow for AI quality and governance.
- Product analytics should allow business-stage outcomes and AgentOps evidence to be correlated without merging their state models.

### Agentized Stage Model

The contract lifecycle should be implemented as an **agentized business workflow**:

- Each contract business stage may be backed by **one or more specialized agents**.
- Those agents are the units that fit naturally into the AgentOps lifecycle for design, validation, deployment, runtime observation, evaluation, drift detection, and feedback.
- The business-stage model remains contract-centric, while the implementation model can be agent-centric.

Example pattern:

| Contract Stage | Possible Agentization Pattern |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Request / Initiation | Intake agent, metadata validation agent |
| Authoring / Drafting | Drafting agent, clause recommendation agent |
| Internal Review | Redline analysis agent, version diff agent |
| Compliance Check | Policy mapping agent, regulatory review agent |
| Negotiation / External Review | Counterparty review agent, fallback recommendation agent |
| Approval Routing | Routing agent, escalation agent |
| Execution / Signature | Signature orchestration agent, reminder agent |
| Post-Execution / Obligations | Obligation extraction agent, task assignment agent |
| Renewal / Expiry | Renewal detection agent, alert prioritization agent |
| Analytics | Reporting agent, insight summarization agent |

This model allows the contract lifecycle to "wrap around" AgentOps operationally without merging lifecycle states.

### What happens if we do not solve this

- Legal remains a bottleneck for routine agreements.
- High-risk clauses are handled inconsistently across reviewers.
- Obligations, renewals, and post-signature commitments continue to leak value.
- Reporting remains retrospective instead of operational.

### Key Findings

1. The market has converged on lifecycle-wide intelligence rather than point automation.
   Ironclad and Juro both position AI as embedded across intake, review, negotiation, approvals, repository search, and renewals rather than as a one-off chatbot.

2. Playbooks and clause libraries are prerequisites, not optional enhancements.
   Juro repeatedly emphasizes that AI quality depends on structured playbooks, fallback clauses, escalation points, and explainable outputs. This aligns with the need for pre-approved clause libraries in drafting, review, and negotiation.

3. Intake and routing are high-value automation targets.
   Ironclad frames intake as the "front door of legal" and highlights metadata extraction plus form population as a material cycle-time reducer. This validates Stage 1 and Stage 6 as core workflow stages, not administrative overhead.

4. Redlining, review, and negotiation need explainability.
   Both Ironclad and Juro emphasize reasoning, source-backed recommendations, and human control. Black-box redlines are not acceptable in legal workflows.

5. Post-signature stages are essential product scope.
   Cflow and Juro both stress renewal management, obligation tracking, searchable repositories, and alerting as critical to ROI. Stopping at signature would leave major business value unrealized.

6. Analytics must be operational, not passive reporting.
   The strongest market pattern is stage metrics tied to approvals, renewals, backlog, risk concentration, and throughput rather than static contract archives.

7. Responsible AI and privacy controls must be built into the operating model.
   NIST AI RMF supports trustworthiness, measurement, and governance. UK GDPR and CCPA require accountability, data minimization, notices, correction/deletion rights, and controls over personal or sensitive information. eIDAS highlights the need for trusted digital signature and evidence services for cross-border electronic transactions.

### Comparison Matrix

| Solution | Workflow Coverage | Notable Strengths | Weaknesses / Gaps Observed | User Reception Signal |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Ironclad | Intake to renewal | Lifecycle-wide agents, workflow-native AI, HITL governance, repository search | Heavy emphasis on internal workflow engine; less detail publicly visible on post-signature obligation modeling depth | Public positioning focuses on reducing manual bottlenecks and preserving human control |
| Juro | Draft, review, approval, sign, store, track, analytics | AI-native CLM, playbook-driven review, explainability, self-serve business workflows, adoption guidance | Public materials emphasize in-house legal and SMB/mid-market ease of use more than deep enterprise process orchestration | Strong public adoption narrative; multiple quotes stress time savings and reduced bottlenecks |
| Cflow | Workflow automation across creation, approval, compliance, renewal, analytics | Clear stage automation language, measurable cycle-time claims, audit trail and renewal focus | More workflow-automation-led than legal-domain-specific AI depth | Public content strongly reinforces common workflow pain points and ROI arguments |

### User Needs Validation

Evidence from public sources consistently points to the same recurring pain:

- Manual review and email chains slow approvals and create version confusion.
- Legal teams need self-serve intake and drafting for routine work.
- Missed renewals and buried obligations create avoidable cost and risk.
- AI adoption fails when the workflow is unclear, the playbook is weak, or outputs are not explainable.

Direct independent review-platform extraction was limited during this research pass, so the strongest user signals here come from vendor-published adoption guidance, public practitioner quotes surfaced in Juro content, and cross-vendor pattern consistency. This is a known evidence gap and should be supplemented with stakeholder interviews before final prioritization.

### Chosen Approach Rationale

The recommended product shape is a stage-aware contract lifecycle workflow with AI assistance at every stage, but with deterministic policy controls, structured outputs, and human checkpoints at review, compliance exceptions, negotiation exceptions, and approval.

This approach was chosen because it matches both the market direction and the repo's current architecture: AI agents already exist for intake, extraction, compliance, and approval, and the workflow infrastructure can be extended to support the remaining lifecycle stages.

It also matches the repo's existing operating model: the `contract-agentops-demo` already uses AgentOps as the lifecycle for AI design, runtime validation, deployment, monitoring, evaluation, drift detection, and feedback. The new contract stages should sit on top of that platform as the business process being executed and observed.

### Rejected Alternatives

| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|--------------|
| Chatbot-only legal assistant | Too shallow for routing, auditability, lifecycle tracking, and deterministic governance |
| Signature-only or review-only point solution | Solves one bottleneck but leaves obligations, renewals, and analytics fragmented |
| Fully autonomous contract processing with no HITL | Not credible for legal risk, exception handling, or explainability |
| Repository-only analytics after signature | Misses upstream value in intake, drafting, review, compliance, and negotiation |

## 7. User Flows

### Primary Flow: Standard Contract Lifecycle

1. Requestor submits an intake request.
2. System validates completeness and recommends template.
3. Requestor or legal author creates first draft from approved language.
4. Internal reviewers receive AI-generated summary, diffs, and redline suggestions.
5. Compliance engine scores the contract and flags deviations.
6. If counterparty paper or redlines exist, negotiation assistant evaluates clause changes and recommends response.
7. Approval routing sends the contract to the correct approvers based on rules.
8. Approved contract moves to e-signature.
9. Signed contract is parsed for obligations, milestones, and renewal terms.
10. Portfolio analytics updates in near real time.

### Exception Flow: High-Risk Contract

1. Compliance or negotiation stage detects a high-risk deviation.
2. System blocks auto-progression.
3. Contract is escalated to legal or security approver with AI rationale and cited evidence.
4. Reviewer approves, rejects, or requests revision.
5. Workflow resumes only after explicit decision.

### Renewal Flow

1. System extracts renewal date, auto-renewal clause, and notice period.
2. Owner receives alert at configured notice intervals.
3. Dashboard prioritizes renewals by value, risk, and time remaining.
4. Renewal decision launches amendment, renegotiation, or termination workflow.

---

## 8. Dependencies and Constraints

### Dependencies

- Approved contract templates per contract type
- Clause library with fallback positions
- Playbook and policy corpus by jurisdiction and risk domain
- Approval matrix with owner and escalation logic
- E-signature platform integration
- Contract repository and search index
- Structured analytics model and workflow event telemetry
- AI evaluation datasets and baseline metrics
- AgentOps telemetry, evaluation, drift, and feedback surfaces from the existing platform

### Constraints

- Legal AI outputs must remain explainable and reviewable.
- Contract data may contain personal or sensitive information and must support privacy obligations.
- Signature and trust-service behavior must be jurisdiction-aware.
- The existing `contract-agentops-demo` architecture is already oriented around intake, extraction, compliance, approval, evaluation, drift, and feedback; new stages should extend that model rather than replace it.
- AgentOps must remain intact as the SDLC and operational lifecycle. Contract Lifecycle must be added as a business workflow layer, not as a replacement for AgentOps stages or views.

---

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Wrong template recommendation | Bad draft quality and rework | Confidence thresholds, user confirmation, fallback to manual choice |
| Hallucinated legal recommendation | Legal and compliance exposure | Retrieval grounding, citations, schema validation, HITL checkpoints |
| Poor playbook quality | AI outputs drift from company policy | Playbook governance, clause-library ownership, periodic review |
| Misrouted approvals | Delay and governance failure | Deterministic routing rules plus exception audits |
| Missed obligations due to extraction error | Operational or financial exposure | Confidence scoring, human verification for high-value contracts |
| Privacy violations in contract data handling | Regulatory and reputational risk | Data minimization, notices, retention rules, deletion/correction workflows |
| Over-automation reduces user trust | Low adoption | Explainability, transparent overrides, pilot with measurable wins |
| Cross-border signature assumptions are wrong | Enforceability concerns | Use trusted e-sign provider, legal review by jurisdiction, evidence retention |

### Agentization Principle

The recommended operating model is:

- Business stakeholders see **contract stages**.
- Platform and AI operators configure **agents mapped to those stages**.
- AgentOps handles the lifecycle of those agent units across design, test, deploy, run, monitor, evaluate, detect, and feedback.
- Reporting correlates the business-stage view and the agent evidence view without collapsing them into one status model.

### Standards and Compliance Notes

- **NIST AI RMF** supports the trustworthiness and governance model for AI-assisted legal workflows.
- **UK GDPR / GDPR-style controls** require attention to lawful basis, minimization, security, accountability, AI explainability, and international transfers where contract data contains personal information.
- **CCPA / CPRA** requires notices, deletion/correction handling, and controls over sensitive personal information for in-scope businesses.
- **eIDAS** highlights the need for trusted electronic signature and trust-service evidence in EU contexts and cross-border transactions.
- **US electronic signature requirements** should be confirmed with legal counsel and selected provider capabilities before implementation decisions are finalized.

### Product Positioning Statement

This product is not just AI for drafting. It is AI plus workflow orchestration across the full contract lifecycle, with explainable recommendations, deterministic controls, human approvals, and portfolio intelligence.

It is also not a replacement for AgentOps. The contract lifecycle is the business process, while AgentOps remains the lifecycle that governs how the AI system is designed, deployed, measured, and improved.
