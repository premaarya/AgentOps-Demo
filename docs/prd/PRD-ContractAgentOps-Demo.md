# PRD: Contract AgentOps Demo - Microsoft Foundry

> **Architecture Update (2026-03-07)**: The React dashboard has been archived. The primary UI is now a static vanilla HTML/CSS/JS dashboard under `ui/`, served at `http://localhost:8000`. References to "React dashboard" below are historical.
> **Product Scope Update (2026-03-10)**: The Interactive Workflow Designer Canvas scope has been merged into this document. This is the single canonical PRD for the contract demo.
> **Lifecycle Clarification (2026-03-11)**: This demo now explicitly preserves two lifecycle models. **Contract Lifecycle** is the business workflow for agreements, with the active MVP focused on the pre-execution path from intake through approval. **AgentOps** remains the SDLC and operational lifecycle for AI systems (design, test, deploy, run, monitor, evaluate, detect, feedback). The demo shows how AgentOps supports and governs the contract business workflow rather than replacing it.

**Epic**: Contract AgentOps Demo
**Status**: Draft
**Author**: Product Manager Agent
**Date**: 2026-03-04
**Stakeholders**: Piyush Jain (Creator/Lead), Demo Audiences, Microsoft Foundry Users

## 1. Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Organizations struggle to operationalize AI agents beyond initial prototypes. While building an AI agent is straightforward with modern SDKs, the hard part is **operating** it at enterprise scale -- monitoring for drift, collecting human feedback, evaluating quality, managing model changes, and governing agent behavior. There is no end-to-end demo that shows the full AgentOps lifecycle using a realistic business scenario with Microsoft Foundry.

In this demo, the realistic business scenario is a **contract lifecycle workflow**. The contract lifecycle is the domain workflow being executed by the system, while AgentOps is the lifecycle used to design, validate, deploy, observe, and improve the AI capabilities that support that business workflow.

### Why is this important?

- **Education Gap**: Teams understand "build an agent" but not "operate an agent" -- the 80% of work that happens after deployment
- **Microsoft Foundry Showcase**: Demonstrates the complete Foundry + Agent 365 value proposition in a tangible, relatable scenario
- **Enterprise Relevance**: Contract management is universal -- every organization handles contracts, making the demo immediately relatable
- **Visual Impact**: The interactive design canvas, workflow test surfaces, and operational dashboard make the invisible (drift, evaluations, feedback loops) visible and interactive

### Dual-Lifecycle Framing

| Lifecycle | Purpose | Example Stages |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Contract Lifecycle | Business workflow for agreements | Request, Drafting, Review, Compliance, Negotiation, Approval |
| AgentOps Lifecycle | SDLC and operational workflow for the AI system | Design, Test, Deploy, Run, Monitor, Evaluate, Detect, Feedback |

The demo must make this distinction legible:

- The **Contract Lifecycle** explains where an agreement is in the active pre-execution business process.
- The **AgentOps Lifecycle** explains how the AI system supporting that process is authored, validated, deployed, observed, and improved.
- The contract domain gives the AgentOps demo a concrete business narrative.

### Agentized Business Workflow Principle

The contract business workflow should fit naturally into AgentOps by treating business stages as **agentized execution units**:

- A contract stage may be powered by one or more specialized agents.
- Those agents are designed in **Design**, validated in **Test**, packaged in **Deploy**, executed in **Run/Live Workflow**, and observed or improved through **Monitor, Evaluate, Detect, and Feedback**.
- The audience should understand that AgentOps governs the agent implementation of the contract workflow, while the contract lifecycle remains the business narrative.

### What happens if we don't solve this?

AgentOps remains a theoretical concept in slide decks. Decision-makers cannot visualize what operationalizing agents actually looks like. Foundry adoption stays limited to "build and forget" agent prototypes that never mature into production-grade systems.

## 2. Target Users

### Primary Users

**User Persona 1: Demo Presenter (Piyush / Technical Evangelists)**
- **Goals**: Deliver a compelling, interactive AgentOps demo that showcases the full lifecycle
- **Pain Points**: Static slides do not convey the operational complexity; need live, interactive visuals
- **Behaviors**: Runs demos in conference talks, customer workshops, internal enablement sessions

**User Persona 2: Demo Audience (Technical Decision Makers)**
- **Goals**: Understand how AgentOps works in practice, not just theory
- **Pain Points**: Cannot visualize LLM drift, feedback loops, or quality gates from bullet points alone
- **Behaviors**: Evaluates platforms by seeing them in action; asks "show me" not "tell me"

**User Persona 3: Developer Learning AgentOps**
- **Goals**: Clone the repo, run the demo locally, learn by exploring the code
- **Pain Points**: No reference implementation that covers the full AgentOps lifecycle
- **Behaviors**: Learns by doing; wants runnable code, not documentation

### Secondary Users

- **Microsoft Foundry Product Team** -- reference demo for customer enablement
- **Solution Architects** -- reference architecture for enterprise agent deployments

## 6. User Flows

### Primary Flow: End-to-End Demo (The 8-Act Story)

**Trigger**: Presenter opens the Contract AgentOps Dashboard
**Preconditions**: All 8 MCP servers running, sample contracts loaded, dashboard accessible

**Steps**:

1. **Act 1 -- Design Canvas**: Presenter creates or loads a workflow, configures agents, validates the design, and activates it. The audience sees that workflow design is interactive rather than hardcoded.
   The presenter can explain that one contract stage may map to one or more agents, depending on complexity.

2. **Act 2 -- Workflow Test Lab**: Presenter selects a representative scenario such as a high-risk MSA and runs the workflow test. The dashboard shows expected outcomes, workflow coverage, and pass/warn/fail results. Audience sees whether the designed workflow is fit for purpose.

3. **Act 3 -- Deploy Dashboard**: Presenter triggers a simulated deployment pipeline. Shows stages: Build -> Test -> Deploy -> Register. Agent 365 IDs appear. Agents are now "live."

4. **Act 4 -- Live Workflow**: Presenter drops a sample NDA into the intake. The workflow view animates: Intake (classifies) -> Extraction (pulls terms) -> Compliance (checks policies -- flags liability cap > $1M) -> Approval (routes to human). Pipeline pauses. Presenter approves. Contract moves to "Archived."
   This act represents the **business contract lifecycle in motion** inside the AgentOps **Run** stage.
   Under the hood, each visible business stage may be backed by multiple agents or sub-agents, but the audience still sees a coherent contract-stage story.

5. **Act 5 -- Monitor Panel**: Presenter switches to the monitor view. Shows traces for the NDA just processed -- every agent step, every tool call, latency bars. Expands the Compliance Agent trace to show its reasoning.

6. **Act 6 -- Evaluation Lab**: Presenter clicks "Run Suite." The active 57-case corpus is evaluated. Results: 39 pass, 18 fail. Quality gate: FAIL. The lab shows extraction 87.5%, compliance 83.5%, classification 91.5%, false-flag rate 9.9%, latency P95 2.3s, and judge scores relevance 4.1/5, groundedness 4.0/5, coherence 4.4/5.

7. **Act 7 -- Drift Detection**: Presenter opens the drift view. LLM drift chart shows accuracy declining from 92% to 81% over five weekly checkpoints, crossing the 85% threshold. "DRIFT DETECTED" alert. Data drift shows a new "AI Services" contract type appearing in 15% of recent contracts. Model swap analysis shows GPT-4o-mini saves 60% cost with a 3.1% accuracy drop that remains inside the demo threshold.

8. **Act 8 -- Feedback Loop**: Presenter submits feedback: "Missed termination clause in Exhibit B." Clicks "Optimize Now" -- negative feedback becomes a test case. Clicks "Re-Evaluate" -- updated suite runs. Opens prompt editor, adds instruction for exhibit scanning. Re-evaluates -- accuracy improves to 91%. Shows the loop closing.

**Success State**: Audience has seen all 8 AgentOps stages live, with real data flowing through the system.

### Secondary Flow: Developer Self-Guided Exploration

**Trigger**: Developer clones the repo and runs `npm start`
**Steps**:
1. Developer reads README, installs dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Starts MCP servers + gateway + dashboard (single `npm start` command)
3. Follows interactive tutorial overlay (optional)
4. Explores each stage by processing sample contracts

### Alternative Flows

- **Flow A: MCP-Only Demo (No UI)**: Run MCP tools from command line or Copilot Chat -- useful for developer-focused audiences.
- **Flow B: Single Stage Deep-Dive**: Zoom into one stage (e.g., Evaluation Lab only) for a focused 5-minute demo.
- **Flow C: Failure Scenario**: Submit a contract that deliberately fails compliance -- show how the system handles rejected contracts.

## 7. Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Unavailable |
|------------|------|--------|----------------------|
| Microsoft Foundry (GPT-5.4) | External | Available | HIGH -- core agent inference. Fallback: use simulated responses |
| Node.js 20+ | Runtime | Available | HIGH -- gateway, UI, and MCP control plane |
| Python 3.11+ | Runtime | Available | HIGH -- Microsoft Agent Framework executor runtime |
| @modelcontextprotocol/sdk | Library | Available | HIGH -- official MCP TypeScript SDK |
| Microsoft Agent Framework + Foundry SDK/runtime | Library | Available | HIGH -- primary agent orchestration path |
| Static dashboard UI served by gateway | Frontend | Available | MEDIUM -- primary operator experience |
| Fastify + ws | Library | Available | MEDIUM -- API gateway + WebSocket |

### Technical Constraints

- Must run locally without Azure subscription (simulated mode) for maximum demo portability
- Must also support live Foundry mode when Azure is available
- All sample data must be synthetic -- no real contracts or PII
- MCP servers must follow the standard MCP protocol for interoperability
- All prompts stored in `prompts/` directory as `.md` files (not inline in code)
- Contract business-stage state and AgentOps stage state must remain separate conceptual models even when displayed in the same operator experience
- Contract stages should be implementable as one or more agents so the business workflow composes naturally into the AgentOps lifecycle

### Resource Constraints

- Single developer (with AI assistance)
- Demo-quality (not production-grade) -- focus on visual impact and correctness, not scale

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Foundry API unavailable during demo | High | Low | Implement simulation mode with pre-recorded responses |
| MCP SDK breaking changes (preview) | Medium | Medium | Pin versions, abstract MCP layer |
| LLM responses non-deterministic | Medium | High | Use temperature=0, seed parameter; cache responses for demo reliability |
| Demo takes too long (>20 min) | Medium | Medium | Build "fast forward" buttons and pre-loaded states |
| Audience questions exceed demo scope | Low | High | Prepare FAQ slide, have simulated data for ad-hoc queries |
| Model quality insufficient for extraction | High | Low | Use GPT-5.4 with structured outputs; pre-validate all 5 sample contracts |

## 10. Out of Scope

**Explicitly excluded**:

- Production contract processing system -- this is a demo, not a product
- Real Azure Document Intelligence OCR -- simulated extraction for portability
- Real Azure AI Search integration -- simulated search with local data
- Multi-tenant support or user authentication
- Mobile-responsive design (optimized for projector/large screen)
- Real CI/CD pipeline execution (simulated deployment stages)
- Real Agent 365 integration (governance view is simulated)
- Internationalization / multi-language contracts

**Future Considerations**:

- Convert demo into a workshop with hands-on labs
- Add industry-specific variants (healthcare, finance, government)
- Integrate with real Azure services for "production mode" demo

## 11. Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| Should MCP servers use Python (FastMCP) or TypeScript? | Piyush | **Resolved** | **TypeScript** -- MCP remains a TypeScript business-tool boundary owned by the existing control plane |
| Should the runtime be Node-only or mixed | Piyush | **Resolved** | **Mixed runtime** -- TypeScript gateway, static UI, and MCP servers remain in place, while Python hosts the Microsoft Agent Framework executor |
| Should the dashboard use React or Streamlit? | Piyush | **Resolved** | **Static dashboard served by the gateway** -- the React track is archived and the static runtime is the canonical UI |
| How realistic should simulated drift data be? | Piyush | Open | Recommend 4-week simulated degradation with configurable parameters |
| Should we include a "reset demo" button? | Piyush | Open | Recommend yes -- essential for repeated demo runs |
| Pre-recorded vs. live LLM calls during demo? | Piyush | Open | Recommend hybrid: live by default, fallback to cached for reliability |

### Contract Agent Definitions

| Agent | Model | Tools (MCP) | Boundaries |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|
| Intake Agent | GPT-5.4 | Intake MCP | Classify and route only -- no extraction or compliance |
| Extraction Agent | GPT-5.4 | Extraction MCP | Extract terms only -- no compliance judgment |
| Compliance Agent | GPT-5.4 | Compliance MCP | Flag risks against policy -- no approval authority |
| Approval Agent | GPT-5.4 | Workflow MCP | Route approvals, escalate -- no policy changes |

### Lifecycle Model

| Layer | Meaning in the Demo |
|-------|----------------------|
| Contract Lifecycle | The business workflow of an agreement from request through analytics |
| AgentOps Lifecycle | The lifecycle for designing, validating, deploying, observing, evaluating, detecting drift, and improving the AI system |

**Mapping principle**:

- **Design / Test / Deploy** are AgentOps lifecycle views that prepare the AI system.
- **Live Workflow** is where the contract business workflow is visualized during the AgentOps **Run** stage.
- **Monitor / Evaluate / Drift / Feedback** remain AgentOps lifecycle views, but they can reference contracts, contract stages, and business outcomes as evidence.
- The contract lifecycle should enrich the demo narrative without replacing the AgentOps stage model.

### Stage-To-Agent Mapping Principle

| Business Concept | AgentOps-Aligned Implementation Concept |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Contract lifecycle stage | One or more agents collaborating on a business step |
| Stage design | Agent composition, prompts, tools, boundaries, schemas |
| Stage validation | Agent tests, scenario tests, evaluation suites |
| Stage deployment | Agent package promotion and registration |
| Stage execution | Agent runtime activity inside the business workflow |
| Stage monitoring | Trace, latency, tool calls, evaluations, drift, and feedback for the agents backing that stage |

### Design Canvas Notes

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Workflow authoring source of truth | Design Canvas in the static dashboard |
| Supported topologies | Sequential, parallel, sequential plus HITL, fan-out, conditional |
| Persistence | Save and load through the workflow API, with local fallback when needed |
| Validation | Structural validation occurs during authoring, save, and push |
| Advanced controls | Export and enhanced canvas navigation are desirable but secondary to the core authoring flow |

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Dashboard | Static HTML/CSS/JS served by gateway | 8 interactive views |
| MCP Servers | TypeScript + @modelcontextprotocol/sdk | 8 tool servers |
| API Gateway | Fastify + ws (TypeScript) | REST API + WebSocket |
| Agent Orchestration | Python Microsoft Agent Framework with Foundry | Multi-agent pipeline |
| LLM (Agents) | Microsoft Foundry (GPT-5.4) | Agent reasoning |
| LLM (Judge) | Microsoft Foundry (GPT-5.4) | Evaluation scoring (LLM-as-judge) |
| Data Store | Local JSON files | Contracts, feedback, eval results |
| Charts | Native UI charts and dashboard visualizations | Drift trends, eval metrics, feedback trends |
| Styling | Static dashboard styles | Dashboard design |
| Runtime | Mixed: Node.js 20+ plus Python 3.11+ | TypeScript control plane plus Python execution plane |

### Glossary

- **AgentOps**: The discipline of operationalizing AI agents end-to-end (build, deploy, monitor, evaluate, optimize)
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol -- standard for tools that AI agents can call
- **HITL**: Human-in-the-Loop -- requiring human approval for high-risk decisions
- **LLM-as-Judge**: Using a separate LLM instance to score agent outputs on qualitative dimensions (relevance, groundedness, coherence)
- **LLM Drift**: Quality degradation of LLM outputs over time (model updates, distribution changes)
- **Data Drift**: Change in the distribution of incoming data vs. what agents were trained/prompted for
- **Quality Gate**: Automated pass/fail check that blocks deployment if quality thresholds are not met
- **Ground Truth**: Known-correct answers used to evaluate agent accuracy
